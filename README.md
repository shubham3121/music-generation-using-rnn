## Music Generation using Recurrent Neural Network

### Introduction

The current technological advancements have transformed the way we not only produce, but listen and work with music. And with the advent of deep learning it has now become possible to generate music without the need of working with instruments artists may not have had access to or the skills to use previously. This offers artists more creative freedom and ability to explore different domains in music.

In this notebook, we will use Recurrent Neural Networks, to build a character-based model that generates jazz piano notes.

### Required Libraries

We use the following libraries: 

- keras 
- tensorflow
- music21
- pandas 
- numpy
- pygame
- timidity

### Data

You can download the MIDI files from the following site: 'http://www.midiworld.com/'
